## General Info

This project is a database of information about music artists and albums, a music library. I have built it with the aim to dive deep into React and make a "real-world" application with authentication and realtime database provided by Firebase. 
This application uses Firebase authentication system, Firestore for database and Firebase Storage for image uploads.
